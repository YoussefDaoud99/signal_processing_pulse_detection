### Signal processing and Pulse detection

The project is a part of my training at ENS Paris Saclay while pursuing the master [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) "Math√©matiques, Vision et Apprentissage".

The project is divided into two main parts. The first one is to process and analyze a voice signal (PSD, Spectrogram, Calculate the voice pitch ...). The second part is to implement a simple method for pulse detection in a set of voice signals.
